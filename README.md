# Respect Art Direction

In version 4.4, WordPress released responsive image support in core. This meant
sites would automatically benefit from responsive images through the `src-set`
attribute.

However, this feature does not account for art direction, a common problem in
responsive design.

This plugin is a proof of concept for a way to solve this.
